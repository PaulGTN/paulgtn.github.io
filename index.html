                <h1>This is <em class=still>still</em> a motherfucking website.</h1>

                <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>

                <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>

                <h3>7 fucking declarations.</h3> 
                <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em class=still>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:
                <ul>
                <li>Shit's <em class=still>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
                <li><em class=still>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
                <li><em class=still>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
                <li>The motherfucker's <em class=still>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
                <li>Shit's <em class=still>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

                <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="third">
                <h2>Let it breathe</h2>
                <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <span id="classic">line-height: 1.4</span> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.
                 If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="fourth">
                <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
                <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="fifth">
                <h2>Size Matters</h2>
                <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="sixth">
                <h3>YLine-width, motherfucker</h3>
                <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id=seventh>
                <h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
                <p>I love what the creator of <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">this site's inspiration did</a>. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
